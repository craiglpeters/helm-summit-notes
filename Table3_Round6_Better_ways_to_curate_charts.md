# New, Better ways to curate charts, and link back to back to owners of chart.

Table 3, Round 6.

## Raised issues:

1. Maintainers are not able to update their charts fast enough
2. Kubernetes org with Prow - Aaron C said they they are happy to add people to the k8s github org
3. Contact information from ownership
4. Members or collaborators?
5. How do you find owners?
